# Peregrine Benchmarks — M0 Baseline

Status: **M0 gate recorded** (TDD §10.3, M0 performance gate: *"Parser
throughput benchmarked (GB/s) and recorded as the baseline for Pass 1"*).

These numbers are **dev-sandbox baselines**, not Apple Silicon results. They
exist to (a) prove the benchmark harness works end-to-end from day one and
(b) give Pass 1 (M1) a regression anchor. Nothing here is a product claim —
the perf doc's Phase P0 replaces every one of these numbers with measured
Apple Silicon baselines.

## Harness

* Framework: Criterion (macro-free entry point so the workspace `missing_docs`
  gate stays intact).
* Unit: `pgr_format::summarize` — the structural parse: header walk, all load
  commands, all sections, the full symbol table, every relocation entry, and
  a complete chained-fixups chain walk.
* Corpus: deterministic arm64 executables built by `pgr-fixtures` (no I/O,
  no clocks; identical bytes every run).
* Reproduce with:

```sh
cargo bench -p pgr-format
```

## Recorded baseline (M0, commit at v0.1.0)

| Bench | Input | Median | Throughput |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pgr-format/summarize/single_image` | ~48 KiB exec (512 syms, 1 Ki relocs, ~85 got slots) | ~0.96 µs | **~53 GiB/s** |
| `pgr-format/summarize/corpus_24_images` | ~7.6 MiB corpus (24 execs, 4 096 syms + 8 192 relocs each) | ~181 µs | **~25.7 GiB/s** |

Machine context (honest caveat): 2-core Intel Xeon (KVM guest), warm cache;
the corpus is L2/L3-resident, so these are *metadata-walk* rates, not DRAM
streaming rates. `summarize` touches the metadata tables (symtab, relocs,
fixup slots), not section payload bytes — the real Pass 1 parser will touch
every input byte and therefore start well below these numbers.

## How to read this

1. The baseline is the **starting line**, not a target. M1's parallel parse
   (LPT-scheduled per file, hash-binned interning) is gated on beating this
   per-thread rate at the same corpus, then on parallel efficiency.
2. Per-pass budgets from the perf doc (§9.3) will be enforced in CI as they
   land: `--time` JSON, single-threaded fraction ≤ 15% (except flush),
   parallel efficiency ≥ 70% on Passes 1/3/4.
3. Nightly wall-clock benchmarks against ld-prime / `ld64.lld` / mold-macho
   require the Apple Silicon rigs from Phase P0 (perf doc §9.1) — the CI
   skeleton for that ships with this milestone, the hardware baselines do
   not exist yet.

## Known follow-ups

* Add a bench for the *byte-touching* parse (section data copied/summed) so
  the M1 parser baseline is memory-bound, not metadata-bound.
* Parameterize the corpus generator (symbols/relocs/got slots) behind CLI
  flags of a small `xtask` so nightly runs can sweep corpus shapes.
